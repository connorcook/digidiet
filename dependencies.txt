Dependencies, Plugins, etc for Deployment

Composer.json -> used to install Laravel and other resources for PHP framework-facilitated development
-(will be using this a lot in the future!)
-install in project root under /bin
Requires:
-Following should be under plugins or config settings for XAMP, WAMP, etc: email me with questions (cookcon1@umbc.edu)
--php:
---mcrypt
---curl
---cgi
---apache
--and of course, php should be installed already- please do so immediately if it hasn't!
--PHAR (PHP archive) and JSON should be recognized by the server correctly- Composer install will fail if not. Fix by editing php.ini config file

Laravel -> installed trivially via Composer in project root (_not_ /bin)
- Install includes Hello World and example of View/Controller usage
- Read up on URIs in the context of RESTful architectures: critical to early deployment

Git Repo MUST be inside the server root directory
-- KNOW YOUR SERVER ROOT, and change if its not easy to access. (ie: Linux users may want to change their server root in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.ini to /home/*username*/)
-- Avoid enabling unnecessary settings and plugins in config- will make it difficult in the future to do standardized testing
