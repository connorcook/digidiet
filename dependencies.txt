Dependencies, Plugins, etc for Deployment

Laravel has been installed in the repo!
-Installed under temp name of "digidiet"
-Access splash page with localhost/*reponame*/digidiet/public/
-reponame is by default "Section-2-Team-3"
-Requires:
-Following should be under plugins or config settings for XAMP, WAMP, etc: email me with questions (cookcon1@umbc.edu)
--Following should be enabled in php/php.ini 
--(XAMP/WAMP users can right click on WAMP/XAMP icon and enable/disable these under PHP settings)
___________

---mcrypt.so
---json.so
---openssl.so
---phar.so
---mysql.so
---curl.so
---cgi.so
---apache.so
---zip.so
____________
--# is comment marker for php, to enable, remove # from existing entry
--If php.ini does not include one of these plugins already...
-- .. FIRST add it to the list yourself in the same format as the others
-- THEN try to download and install the extension yourself if that doesn't work.


Git Repo MUST be inside the document root directory of server!
-- KNOW YOUR DOCUMENT ROOT. for XAMP/WAMP/MAMP, its in htdocs in the main XAMP folder
-- linux users have their document root in one of several places: check your repo for more info. (mine is in /srv/http/)
-- Avoid enabling unnecessary settings and plugins in config- will make it difficult in the future to do standardized testing

*AMP users should have these plugins already: if you are missing any and putting them in php.ini doesn't work,
-- find the extensions online via google.
*nix users may be missing the packages necessary: if something is missing, check your package manager first. 
---(Many php extensions are located there!)
We are using PHP5.4- check which version you have and if you have the option, switch to 5.4.
-- Currently more ideal to use 5.4 for conflict-free development.
